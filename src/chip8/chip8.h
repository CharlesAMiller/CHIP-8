/**
 * @file chip8.h
 * @brief The implementation of a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) device
 *
 * This module broadly describes the implementation of the CHIP-8 device.

 * The module uses function pointers found in peripherals to keep the device logic more portable
 * and agnostic of particular medial libraries/dependencies.
 *
 * To use the module:
 * 1. Allocate memory suitable for the device
 * 2. Allocate and load the program/instructions to memory
 * 3. Wire your peripherals such that they align with the function pointer signatures described by the `peripherals` struct
 * 4. Call chip8_init with the aforementioned: memory, program memory, and peripherals and assign to a variable
 * 5. Iteratively call chip8_run, passing a reference to your previously assigned chip8 variable
 *
 * @see main.c for a well-defined example usage
