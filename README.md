# [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) Handheld

The goal of this project is to ultimately have a physical handheld device that runs pre-loaded games run on our CHIP-8 emulator. 

## Project Components

### Code 
Housed under `/src`, the code is written in C with the intent of being run on Arduino or another similar embedded device.


## Current Objectives
- Use [circuit.io](https://www.circuito.io/) to create breadboard a PoC of hardware necessary to run our CHIP-8
- Implement basic CHIP-8 in C
